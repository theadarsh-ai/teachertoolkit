T* (message to our friend on WhatsApp, what are we doing? \(Sending it\). * When we take something) Tj
T* (from the internet and save it on our device, it's like bringing it home! This is called **downloading**.) Tj
T* (**Simple Explanation:** Downloading means copying a file \(like a picture, song, video, or) Tj
T* (document\) from the internet onto your computer, tablet, or phone. It's like bringing a treasure from a) Tj
T* (big online library to your own digital locker! ### **Where Do Downloads Go?** Most devices have a) Tj

T* (weigh it, right? Similarly, when you download a file, it has a certain **size** \(measured in MB -) Tj
T* (Megabytes or KB - Kilobytes\). **Quick Checks:** 1. **Look at the download progress:** When) Tj
T* (you're downloading, you'll often see a progress bar or a percentage \(e.g., "50% done", "100%) Tj
T* (done"\). Always wait until it says **100%** or "Download Complete." 2. **Check the file size:**) Tj
T* (Before downloading, some websites show the file size. After downloading, go to your 'Downloads') Tj
T* (folder. Right-click \(or long-press on a phone\) on the file and select "Properties" or "Details.") Tj
T* (Compare the size! If it's much smaller than expected, it might be incomplete or broken. *) Tj
T* (*Example:* If a song is supposed to be 5 MB, and your downloaded file is only 2 MB, something) Tj
T* (might have gone wrong, and the song might not play fully. #### **Test 2: Is it Safe? \(The 'Source &) Tj

T* (inside or where it came from? Probably not! It's the same with files from the internet. **Quick) Tj
T* (Checks:** 1. **Source:** Did you download it from a website you trust \(like NCERT's official website) Tj
T* (for books, or a trusted news site, or your school's official portal\)? Avoid downloading from unknown) Tj
T* (or suspicious pop-up ads. 2. **Name & Type:** Does the file name make sense? \(e.g.,) Tj
T* ('TajMahal_Picture.jpg' instead of 'dfg4532_virus.exe'\). Be careful with files ending in '.exe' – they) Tj
T* (are programs and can sometimes be harmful if not from a very trusted source. Pictures usually end) Tj
T* (in '.jpg' or '.png', documents in '.pdf' or '.doc'. 3. **Too Good to Be True?** If something promises a) Tj
T* (lot \(like "Free unlimited games forever!"\) but comes from a strange place, be cautious. It might be a) Tj
T* (trick to download something harmful! --- ### **Think and Discuss:** * **Rohan** downloaded a) Tj
T* (picture of the **Qutub Minar**, but when he tried to open it, it said "File Corrupted." What could) Tj
T* (have happened? * *\(Hint: Think about Test 1 - completion!\)* * **Priya** saw an advertisement for a) Tj
