The AI Video Generator in your EduAI Platform creates **educational video concepts and detailed scripts** using Vertex AI and Gemini AI, not actual playable video files.

## Generated Content Includes:

1. **Detailed Video Scripts** - Complete narration and dialogue

3. **Learning Objectives** - Educational goals and outcomes
4. **Production Guidelines** - Technical specifications for video creation
5. **Cultural Adaptation** - Content tailored for Indian educational context
6. **Grade-Level Appropriateness** - Content matched to specific grade levels

## How to Use the Generated Content:
